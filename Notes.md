## To do list

1. Build a basic API

	- Look into fonts more
		- https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack
		- https://github.com/jslegers/emoji-icon-font
		- https://github.com/koemaeda/gohufont-ttf
		- https://github.com/ranesr/SwiftIcons
		- https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface
		- https://github.com/Tecate/bitmap-fonts
		- https://github.com/romeovs/creep
		- https://github.com/MicahElliott/Orp-Font

	- Build some basic data logging functions
		+ Maybe this should be a nested class?

1. Reorganize useful links from above (other APIs, fonts) into a useful list

1. Write up basic docs
	- badges from shields.io
		+ Python 3
